      <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

        If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
        But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help
        you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make
        a schedule and this is a <strong> biggie: SET A BUDGET.</strong> If
        you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have
        fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
        you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

        Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be
        uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
        expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
        express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes
        you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but
        you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
